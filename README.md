## Project Structure

The project consists of several components:

- **HTML Pages**: index.html, column.html, bar3.html, map.html, model.html
- **Stylesheets**: CSS files for styling
- **JavaScript**: Script files for functionality and interactivity
- **Machine Learning Model**: Included in model.html, offering predictive analysis

## Features

1. **Data Visualization**: Utilizes Chart.js for state-wise and year-wise analysis.
2. **Geographical Analysis**: Provides insights into accident-prone areas through an embedded map.
3. **Machine Learning Integration**: Includes a machine learning model to predict accidents based on historical trends, which is an [API](https://github.com/raaasin/acc-api) built in Flask
4. **Informative Interface**: Offers information on primary causes of accidents and precautionary measures.

## Installation
